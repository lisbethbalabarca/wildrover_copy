The package is made complete by our crazy, good looking bar staff, fun activities and our live coverage of sporting action from around the globe!<br><br>
When we close the staff will be happy to bring you to the best night-spots allowing you to see more of the city than just our bar.<br><br>

Wild Rover Hostel boasts to be the un-official highest owned Irish bar in the world so when you are ready to kick back and party after surviving the Worldâ€™s Most Dangerous Road you can claim to have enjoyed a Guinness or Jameson at over 3600 meters.<br><br>

We have an all day hangover menu which includes curry chips, our Aussie fries, full Irish breakfast and PG Tips English tea.<br><br>

We organize weekly parties and nightly activities to keep you from getting to comfy in the best beds in South America.</span>
